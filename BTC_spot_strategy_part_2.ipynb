We found that the inclusion of stop orders was necessary for the strategy to be fruitful.\n\nBut what if we changed the target percentages? I chose 3% by eyeballing historical charts and making a best guess as to how this strategy might work. This notebook aims to improve the strategy by testing out 25 combinations of \"rise\" and \"fall\" targets ranging from 1% to 5%. \"Rise\" is the percentage by which the price should rise above the lowest low since the last sell in order to trigger a buy. \"Fall\" is the percentage by which the price should fall below the highest high since the last buy in order to trigger a sell."

This marginally outperforms the original +3%/-3% strategy to give a 1428-fold increase in US dollar value and a 66-fold increase in bitcoin value of our holding.\n\nYear by year winning strategies with corresponding changes are as follows:\n\n - **2015: +3%/-4%** - USD value 251.5%, BTC value 161.4%, BTC price 34.5%\n - **2016: +2%/-2%** - USD value 237.0%, BTC value 50.5%, BTC price 123.8%\n - **2017: +1%/-3%** - USD value 3790.3%, BTC value 164.8%, BTC price 1368.9%\n - **2018: +5%/-2%** - USD value 33.4%, BTC value 404.4%, BTC price -73.6%\n - **2019: +2%/-2%** - USD value 422.4%, BTC value 171.8%, BTC price 92.2%\n \nIntuitively it makes sense that when price is rising rapidly, as in 2017, a trader would benefit by being fast to buy (small \"rise\") and slow to sell (large \"fall\"), and that the opposite would apply when the market is in decline, as in 2018. This shows in these two examples, but overall this pattern is not consistent and there is not enough here to recommend a way of tweaking \"rise\" and \"fall\" settings based on the overall market trend.\n\nAlthough +3%/-4% was the overall best performing strategy, it did produce a slight fall in US dollar holding value in the bear market year of 2018. An unhappy trader risks becoming a undisciplined trader, so perhaps +3%/-3% might have been a more comfortable strategy in terms of consistency, and this one ended up performing better in the last two full years anyway.\n\nAgain, *not* financial advice, and all retrospective with nothing to suggest it will work well on future market movements. I've given you lots of numbers if you'd like to play with them, so happy crunching!"
